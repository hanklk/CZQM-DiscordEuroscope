# CZQM DiscordEuroscope 1.0
A plugin written to provide discord rich presence feature for our lovely EuroScope.
And the good news is that it supports both ES *3.1d* and *3.2*!

All you need is to *load the plugin*, put the config.json and the .dll in the SAME DIRECTORY and load the .dll into Euroscope, and it'll work!
You can download the plugin from the Releases page.
